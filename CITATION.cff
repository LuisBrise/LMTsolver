abstract: >-
  This repository contains a code developed for the
  theoretical study of angular momentum transfer (AMT) from
  swift electrons to spherical nanoparticles using classical
  electrodynamics. The code efficiently computes the
  integrals of the Maxwell stress tensor in frequency space
  through quadrature methods and applies it to various
  materials, including plasmonic and dielectric NPs.
  Designed to handle nanoparticles up to 50 nm in radius, it
  enables the study of AMT across the entire nanoscale,
  offering both analytical solutions and numerical
  implementations for precise calculations.
